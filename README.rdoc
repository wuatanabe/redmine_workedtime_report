redmine_workedtime_report

== Installation
Just drop the plugin in the vendor/plugins folder
Restart redmine
The plugin adds a new group (named workedtimeviewers) 
the first time it runs.
User in the group can enter the WorkTime page

==Description 
Just a alternative simple yet useful view on time entries
(for some reasons the already existing solutions did not
fit my needs)
